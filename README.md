# Geohash.GeoRaptor: .NET Geohash Compression Tool

This is a port of [ashwin711/georaptor](https://github.com/ashwin711/georaptor) to C#/.NET. This tool can be used as a class library or a command line tool. _TODO: Link to NuGet packages_

Geohash.GeoRaptor is a geohash compression library for efficiently reducing the size of large geohash collections. If you are wondering what geohashes are all about, I can recommend checking out [this website by Movable Type](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html) which explains geohashing in simple terms while at the same time providing a highly visual technical demo.
